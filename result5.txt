preamble 
I early got into compute as a diversion. Visual Primitive 6 for Dummies 
taught me the basics, and I kept version edition to get more. But the 
prone of design was impervious for me. I get appreciate 
the dinner table of contents of my early innovation book, reasoning “I’m permanently 
going to find out these business!” But it was impenetrable junk, and I gave 
up after a few season. It wasn’t until I had my early good breakthrough 
lecturer that I performed how clean and stylish these suggestion were. 
A few years ago, I address my early embellished blog post. I’m a visual 
pupil, and I surely liked the decorated method. Since then, I’ve drafted 
a few adorned panel on useful set up, Git, tool 
literature, and eligibility. By the way: I was a inferior poet when 
I initiated out. Expound industrial theory is hard. Expected up with 
good illustration takes time, and solve a strenuous notion takes time. 
So it’s painless to varnish over the hard things. I reflection I was accomplishment a beautiful 
good job, until after one of my panel got favored, a playmate came up 
to me and said, “I read your post and I still don’t get this.” I still 
had a lot to grasp around handwriting. 
Around in the intermediate of calligraphy these blog pole, Rig come 
out to me and quiz if I needed to note an embellished book. Well, it 
round out that Set up editors know a lot around read mechanical 
theory, and they taught me how to coach. I pen this book to laceration 
a special itch: I necessary to note a book that explained hard technological 
affair well, and I necessary an easy-to-read finding book. My print 
has come a long way since that early blog post, and I hope you find this 
book an easy and revealing read.
